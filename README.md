# StreamStuff
Random stuff for random streams

##
## Project Goals

When I have an idea for something for use on my stream, I'll code it into this application so that the small ideas are constructed into a single toolkit.

##
## Current Features
### Counters
The counters tab allows you to create and control counters and output them to files that can then be displayed on stream. Alternatively, it will have a preview mode that allows it to be captured onto a stream and chroma keyed. The colours will eventually be customisable.

##
## Wait... where's the download link?
The project has only just started so it isn't ready to be release even with one feature yet.

Once it is ready to go, there will be a download link so you can try it out.

##
## Ideas? Bugs? Questions?
I'm open to suggestions for things to add so feel free to hit me up on any of these below methods.
